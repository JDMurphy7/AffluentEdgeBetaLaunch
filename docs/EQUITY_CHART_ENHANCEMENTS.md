## Implementation Details

### Responsive Design

The chart now adapts to different screen sizes by:
- Reducing data point density on smaller screens
- Adjusting point sizes based on data density
- Using appropriate date formatting for different timeframes
- Showing/hiding certain UI elements based on available space

### Data Processing

Raw portfolio data goes through several processing steps:
1. Filtering based on selected timeframe
2. Sorting by date
3. Outlier detection and handling
4. Adaptive sampling based on screen size
5. Formatting for display

### Performance Metrics

The chart now calculates and displays:
- Total percentage change for the selected period
- Maximum drawdown percentage
- Visual indicators for profit targets and maximum drawdown limits

### UI Improvements

The updated UI features:
- Interactive timeframe selector
- Performance metrics display
- Improved loading states
- Empty state guidance
- Responsive layout

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:
1. Add data annotations for significant events
2. Implement comparison with market benchmarks
3. Add export functionality for chart data
4. Implement additional technical indicators
5. Add trend analysis and projection capabilities
