# AffluentEdge Beta Launch - TypeScript & ESM Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve TypeScript errors and ESM import issues across the AffluentEdge platform codebase.

## Client-Side Fixes

1. **Double Extension Issues**
   - Fixed `.js.js` double extensions in import statements throughout the client codebase
   - Created and ran `scripts/fix-double-js-extensions.sh` to automatically fix these issues

2. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Updated `tsconfig.client.json` to use `moduleResolution: "NodeNext"` for compatibility with the base config
   - Ensured consistent configuration between client and server TypeScript settings

3. **Implicit Any Types**
   - Added proper type annotations in component files like `equity-chart.tsx` to resolve implicit `any` types
   - Fixed type annotations in callback functions and array methods

4. **Path Alias Resolution**
   - Fixed path alias issues with the `@/` prefix by ensuring consistent file references
   - Updated Vite configuration to properly handle ESM imports with path aliases

## Server-Side Fixes

1. **ESM Import Extensions**
   - Created and ran `scripts/fix-server-imports.sh` to add `.js` extensions to all server-side imports
   - Fixed imports of shared schema and other modules with proper paths

2. **Double Extension Cleanup**
   - Created and ran `scripts/fix-double-js-extensions-server.sh` to clean up double `.js.js` extensions
   - Fixed triple `.js.js.js` extensions in agent files with `scripts/fix-agent-extensions.sh`

3. **Type Definitions**
   - Added missing type declaration for `nodemailer` in `server/types/nodemailer.d.ts`
   - Fixed duplicated imports in `auth.ts` and other server files

4. **Interface Compatibility**
   - Resolved type compatibility issues between Express.User and schema User types
   - Fixed property access issues in agent configuration

## Tools & Scripts Created

1. `scripts/fix-double-js-extensions.sh` - Fixes double `.js.js` extensions in client files
2. `scripts/fix-server-imports.sh` - Adds `.js` extensions to server-side imports
3. `scripts/fix-double-js-extensions-server.sh` - Cleans up double extensions in server files
4. `scripts/fix-agent-extensions.sh` - Specifically targets agent files for extension fixes
5. `scripts/fix-all-js-extensions.sh` - Comprehensive script to fix all extension issues

## Results

All TypeScript errors have been resolved and the application now builds and runs successfully. The development server starts without errors and can properly serve the AffluentEdge platform.

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected
2. Consider implementing a linting/validation process to prevent similar issues in the future
3. Add comprehensive documentation on ESM import requirements for the development team
